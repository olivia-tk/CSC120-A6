- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
In theory it made a lot of sense especially through thinking about it as inheriting a trait from a parent. 
I was a bit confused on what the difference was between importing from another class like we have been doing in the past assignments, but I guess with inheritance, I now think of it more as a continuation of the parent class, in a way that you heavily use what the parent set up for you. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Playing around with the main by putting values or strings (names of people, titles of books, etc) in helped to see if the code is working. Unlike other assignments where I was a little confused by the objective of the code, this was really clear (you have a building, and three things happening in the building) which made it easy to know when my code worked. For someone taking this course in the future, I suggest making sure you fully understand the assignment and what the final product is supposed to look like, before jumping into the code.
